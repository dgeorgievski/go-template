## What is CNOE?

An open source initiative for building internal developer platforms (IDPs). Cloud Native Operational Excellence (aka, CNOE, pronounced Kuh.noo) is a joint effort to share developer tooling, thoughts, and patterns to help organizations make informed technology choices and resolve common pain points. CNOE will enable organizations to navigate tooling sprawl and technology churn by coordinating contributions, offering tools, and providing neutral and unbiased guidance on technology choices to deliver internal developer platforms.

## CNOE Tenets

1. **Open source first:** use of open source technology is prioritized over proprietary technology for each of the technology verticals discussed later in the doc. This helps ensure alignment across all the participating members by allowing them to coordinate on collaborations while having the freedom to update and modify a given technology to their needs

2. **Community driven:** Decisions on the direction of the working group is driven by the community and its governing body. This involves the selection of technologies, level of commitment, and level of contribution.

3. **Tools and not Practices:** CNOE offers suggestions on which tools to use and with what configurations. What practices a given company builds around and above those tools is out of scope for CNOE.

4. **Powered by Kubernetes, but not limited to orchestrate to Kubernetes:** The CNOE working group relies heavily on the success of the CNCF community to choose technologies that are deemed useful to the type of operations required by the community. As such, Kubernetes is considered the de-facto environment to operate CNOE tooling. However, choosing of Kubernetes as the operating environment, does not require for it to be the environment to orchestrate against. Using the right infrastructure as code tooling, the CNOE community can choose to orchestrate against any compute platform of their choice.

5. **Standardized to the infrastructure, customizable by the developers:** CNOE aims at addressing the usability requirements of its stakeholders. While the requirements of the platform could be enforced by the security engineers and infrastructure operators, the usability of it needs to be guaranteed by platform operators and application developers.

6. **Built to be shared:** All CNOE deliverables including the reference architecture and the deployment packages will be developed out in the open and by collaboration of all its participating members and with the goal of making it sharable and usable by the larger open source community of interest.

## What is Internal Developer Platform

An internal developer platform (IDP) is a self-service interface that provides developers with the tools and resources needed to build, deploy, and manage software applications efficiently. It simplifies the development process by abstracting complexity and enabling developers to focus on coding rather than infrastructure management.
